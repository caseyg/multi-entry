*Multi Entry* is a decentralized, primarily-online collection of essays, photos, and other media about the creative culture of mainland China.

The first real "season" of *Multi Entry* was (link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/christinaxu/multi-entry-telling-the-stories-of-young-creative text: funded on Kickstarter by 231 curious backers). It will be based on a two month trip (Sept-Nov 2015) to Xiamen, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Beijing, and Shanghai to document the stories and lives of young creative Chinese people. After the trip, these observations and interviews will be shared in a variety of places (and just as many forms) all over the internet. This site will be a central directory to help you find all of it!

As a first-generation Chinese-American, I'm making this collection because it's what I've always wanted to read about my homeland. I'm dedicated to making sure that *Multi Entry* tells stories that:
* respectfully center the experiences of Chinese people,
* don't fall into lazy tropes,
* and never, *ever* use Engrish as the butt of a joke.

## The Backstory

My family moved from Fuzhou, China to the United States when I was 7 years old. Like many other first-generation immigrant children, I often wonder how my life would have turned out if we hadn’t left. 

In the last few years, I've been going to China as an adult—which is to say, for work and play and *unaccompanied by parents*—and it's granted me the opportunity to befriend some amazing young people. These engineers, artists, entrepreneurs, and designers show me a side of Chinese culture I rarely see in the news: one that’s creative, funny, and vibrant.

During my last few visits to China, I started sharing my observations and experiences in photos accompanied by field notes. I was surprised by how enthusiastically these were received, especially by other Chinese-Americans who craved a fresh perspective on Chinese culture, and this eventually led to the decision to create *Multi Entry* in a serious way.

*Multi Entry* is named after the Multiple Entry visa; since 2014, US citizens can now obtain a 10-year multiple entry visa to China (and vice versa). This new agreement has made it easier than ever to visit China frequently, but simply going there isn’t the same as really getting to see it. For that, you need entry points and guides, and that's what I hope to provide.

## About Me

Hi! I'm (link: http://www.christinaxu.org text: Christina Xu). I'm an ethnographer and organizational designer living in Brooklyn who spends too much time on (link: http://www.twitter.com/xuhulk text: Twitter). I'm also a first-generation Chinese-American: I was born in Fuzhou, Fujian in southeastern China, and moved to the midwestern United States at age 7.

*Multi Entry* is a very personal project, which means that it will almost certainly inherit my postcolonialist perspective, love of the vernacular, and undying devotion to taro/mango/coconut-flavored desserts. Not even a little bit sorry about it.
